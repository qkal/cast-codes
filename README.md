# CastCodes

CastCodes is an open-source terminal and code workspace fork. This repository is being rebranded externally as **CastCodes** while preserving upstream internal crate and module names such as `warp_core`, `warpui`, and `warp_terminal` for now.

## Current Scope

- Public app name: **CastCodes**
- Public binary/package slug: `cast-codes`
- Public app ID: `dev.castcodes.CastCodes`
- Public URL scheme: `castcodes://`
- Local terminal and code workflows are in scope.

The public CastCodes build is local-only by default. It does not include sign-in, hosted telemetry, hosted crash reporting, billing, shared sessions, upstream release feeds, or upstream feedback flows. Feedback links route to this fork's GitHub issue tracker.

## Build

```bash
./script/run
```

For a static packaging check:

```bash
./script/check_ai_attribution
./script/check_rebrand
cargo check -p warp-app --bin cast-codes --features gui
./script/bundle --channel oss --check-only
```

## Repository Notes

This is a staged external rebrand. Do not run blind repository-wide replacements; many remaining internal names are intentional compatibility boundaries.

Use the rebrand guard before shipping public-surface changes:

```bash
./script/check_ai_attribution
./script/check_rebrand
```

`./script/check_ai_attribution` prevents generated-by/model-credit footers
from entering specs, docs, prompts, and public artifacts. Mentions of supported
AI tools are still allowed when they describe real product behavior.
